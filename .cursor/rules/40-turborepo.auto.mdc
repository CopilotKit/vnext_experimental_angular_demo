description: Turborepo pipeline guidance.
globs: "**/turbo*.{json,js}"

- Tasks are defined in `turbo.json` with common names: `build`, `lint`, `dev`, `check-types`, `test`.
- Each task should specify `dependsOn` and `outputs` where caching matters.
- Avoid creating new pipelines at the repo root without discussion.
- Use `turbo run <task>` for workspace-wide scripts.
